		<h3>2019/1/26 - a plan to turn to data science engineer</h3>	
		<h4>why do i have to make a plan to do this？</h4>
		Ok, The main reason why i am faild to become a data science engineeer is i have not make a plan to implement it. ok, my aim to majay data science engineer. In the last one and a half years, i have been trying to study nutch(include hadoop) for joy to crawl the web site, but the bad thing is the result that i have not been a data science engineer even a hadoop developer. This make me very depressed. as for main reason, because i'm just not familiar with the data science engineer at all. the reason why i want to turn to data science engineer is data science is a pretty good direction in the infomation technology on my opinion when i worked for National Engineering Laboratory. My leader C.M tell me the present web develop(i think he point the crud) is so easy with not so many technology challenge, and luckly, i'm very agree with it.
		<h4>why make a plan so important?</h4>
		Ok, here are some advantages: 
		<ul>
			<li>
				<div>
					<h5>check the aim it self</h5>
					<span>
						i confused my idea sometimes. For example，finding a java job is not equals studying java which is a progamming language. some people always do things like this, so, there are so many storys, i'll sort out.
					</span>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div>
					<h5>risk assessment:</h5>
					<span>
						plan help us to avoid error direction, specially in the early time.	
					</span>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<div>
					<h5>check process:</h5>
					<span>
						help us to check the process of the plan.
					</span>
				</div>
			</li>
		</ul>
